*Our children are our future, and this repo is just one extension of one organization trying to help further the education of children. Electronics is an amazing microcosmic world that feeds into so many other areas of interest in science, engineering, and the arts. Take the leap, and expand your knowledge and your child's.*

The Dazzling Electronics Curriculum is a set of activities developed to teach mainly children from ages 9 to 14 about electronics. There are three branches to the curriculum: The Basic Branch, The Builder Branch, and The Methods Branch. Each "branch" consists of activities that target a specific set of interests and topics.

In each activity folder, there is a Frtizing file, circuit schematic, breadboard image of the circuit, and a bill(list) of materials(a.k.a. BOM) for each activity. In addition to that, there is a readme file included which outlines the activity summary, actitvity goals, and the activity procedure.

Also (if not already existant in this repo), there will be instruction sets on how to install ArduBlock and S4A, which are graphical alternatives to using the Adruino IDE to program the Arduino board. A link to the Arduino IDE download instruction set and file will be linked in as well in the wiki.

Check the wiki for valuable information on topics covered in the activities, as well as information on where to get components, equipment, and third party sources of information that will be immensely helpful.

####The Basic Branch
Every student starts on this branch, unless it is decided that the student has enough experience to jump straight into one of the other two branches. Topics covered in these set of activites consist of and are not limited to: basic electronics, basic breadboarding skills, introductory and intermediate circuit design, basic electronics schematic reading and writing, basic programming concpets(functions, variables, and conditional statements), common programming practices(commenting properly and pseudocode), and introduction to the use and implementation of integrated circuits.

Upon the completion of this branch, students decide which of the next two branches they wish to venture upon.

####The Builder Branch
This branch is focused around the student who prefers to build structures and contraptions. The main tenant of this branch is to build a structure of some sort (i.e. a crane or robotic arm) and then actuate it; build something that doesn't do too much and expand upon its abilities and uses through the application of control systems or other hardware/software extension. For example, if a student builds a small crane that a person can lower and raise the arm of it, we will expand upon the design by attaching a servo or other motor to move the arm which would be controlled by a microcontroller such as the Arduino. 

####The Methods Branch
This branch is focused around the student who prefers to learn about applications of hardware and software rather than design and build their own systems. Simply put, this branch is for the student who is not fond around building structures. The main tenant of this branch is to explore the cross sections of electronics and other fields, for example music. One popular set of projects is making a synth using a series of potentiometers, a microcontroller, and a series of other components, and then "see" what's going on through the use of an oscilloscope.

##Activity Breakdown

#####note: an activity with an asterisk next to it means that it is a hardware only, no software, activity.

|Basic Branch | Builder Branch | Methods Branch|
|----------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------|
| LED On* | Arduino Catapult | Photoresistor Theremin* |
| LED Blink* | Electromagnetic Crane* | Making a Synth* |
| Arduino Lighting an LED | Crane on the Move | Making Music |
| Cause and Effect |
| LED Fade* |
| LED PWM |

#####*These lessons have been designed for use during a camp day of 6 hours, where about an hour out of the day is dedicated to doing one or two of these activitiies. *
