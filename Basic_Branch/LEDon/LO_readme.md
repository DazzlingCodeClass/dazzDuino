#LED On


###Activity Summary:
This activity is designed for students to "get their feet wet". Purely meant to be an introductory course to electronic components, breadboards, and schematics, this activity will set the pace for the rest of the curriculum. This is the first activity in the Dazzling Electronics Curriculum: Basic Branch.

####Student's Task:
- Learn what voltage, current, and resistance are and how they interact
- Draw your first circuit schematic
- Learn about breadboards
- Create your first circuit


---
###Activity Goals:
- Become familiar with:
	- basic electronics schematic symbols
	- breadboards
	- basic electronic components
- Form basic knowledge around:
	- Current
	- Voltage
	- Resistance

###Activity Procedure:

1. Gather Supplies.
2. Wire the breadboard according to the schematic in the folder labeled led_on_schem.pdf
3. Gather a piece of paper and a pencil, if you do not have these already.
4. Close the circuit schematic on the computer. Look at the circuit you have created on the breadboard, and draw the circuit for yourself. Remember to use the proper symbols.
