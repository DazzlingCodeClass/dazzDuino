#Arduino On

###Activity Summary:
In this activity, students will be introduced to the Arduino platform. Students will discover the power of digital electronics and the software used in conjunction with it. Programming basics such as variables and functions will covered, as well as programming practices such as proper commenting and writing psuedocode.

####Student's Taks:
- Learn what an Arduino is and how it works
- Create a circuit schematic including an Arduino
- Create your first circuit using an Arduino
- Write your first Arduino program

---

###Activity Goals:
- Introduce the Arduino IDE and Arduino board
- Explain the concepts of variables and functions
- Go over the importance of writing pseudocode, commenting, and documentation

###Activity Procedure:
*This is an outline of the steps you will take. Ask your instructor any question that you may have.*

1.) Gather Supplies.
2.) Connect your Arduino to your computer, and open up the IDE.
3.) Write your program.
4.) Open up the schematic, and read it over. Create your circuit with the Arduino, a breadboard, and other supplies.
5.) Select the correct board type and the correct port. Upload your program.
6.) Test your circuit.
7.) Check the included pdf file called arduino_on_code.pdf which has an example program on it to see how your program compares.
