#Cause and Effect

###Activity Summary:
In this activity, students will discover the power of inputs. The simple concept of a switch provides us with a powerful method of doing an action conditionally. Student will be exposed to the use of conditional programming using if-statements and comparators. In addition, pin states on a microcontroller will be explained.
