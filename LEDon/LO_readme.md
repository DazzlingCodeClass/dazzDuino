#LED On


###Activity Summary:
This activity is designed for students to "get their feet wet". Purely meant to be an introductory course to electronic components, breadboards, and schematics, this activity will set the pace for the rest of the curriculum because during this activity teachers will get to see their students first reaction to the world of electronics. The most critical portion of this activity is the discussion between teacher and student(s) about current, voltage, and resistance. This is the first activity in the Dazzling Electronics Curriculum: Basic Branch.
