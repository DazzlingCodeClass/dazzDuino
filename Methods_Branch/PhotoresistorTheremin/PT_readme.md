#Photoresistor Theremin

###Activity Summary:
In this activity, students will be exposed to a large cross section of mulitple fields such as electronics, music, and many more. With a circuit design of intermediate difficulty, students will be able to create their own music, with an electronic "instrument" that can fit in the palm of their hand and reacts to light.

Students will create a light sensitive theremin using a 555 timer.

This is the sixth activity in the Dazzling Electronics Curriculum: Basic Branch.

###Activity Goals:
- Introduce:
	- photoresistors
	- a basic intergrated circuit(IC)
	- speakers
- Show that multiple career paths can overlap

####Special Note:
If available, use an oscilloscope, and probe around this circuit with students. Show the students what is happening with the frequencies and the signals that the 555 is generating. Reinforce that they are controlling what signals the IC is making through the use of the electronic components they place in the circuit with the 555.

Check the Github wiki to find out more information on oscilloscopes if they are new to you or if you need more information on where to get affordable ones.
